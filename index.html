          <p>Ian isn’t really a big fan of coffee, especially in the summer time when the weather is extremely hot, but when his sister told him about iced coffee, he thought it sounded very nice. Surprisingly, he decided to try one. Basically, it’s an espresso with water and a lot of ice. Therefore, it’s still taste like strong coffee. Ian wasn’t really pleased by the taste and he felt like he wasted his money. He asked for a refund, but it was impossible to have one because he drank it all. His sister was upset that he didn’t like it. She felt guilty since it was her idea so she decided to buy him a lemonade.</p>
